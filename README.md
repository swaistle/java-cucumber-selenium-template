# test-framework-template

Welcome to my little tutorial on how to create a simple Java framework with Maven. I have tried to chunk up the steps
and information into branches.

The order of the branches are as follows:
1. [dependencies](https://github.com/swaistle/java-cucumber-selenium-template/tree/dependencies)
2. [folder-structure](https://github.com/swaistle/java-cucumber-selenium-template/tree/folder-structure)
3. [driver-setup](https://github.com/swaistle/java-cucumber-selenium-template/tree/driver-setup)
4. [feature setup](https://github.com/swaistle/java-cucumber-selenium-template/tree/feature-setup)
5. [running-tests](https://github.com/swaistle/java-cucumber-selenium-template/tree/running-tests)

I hope this helps beginners to get a slight understanding on how to create a framework from scratch and some good 
practices to follow.
