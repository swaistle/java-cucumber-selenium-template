# test-framework-template

Welcome to my little tutorial on how to create a simple Java framework with Maven. I have tried to chunk up the steps
and information into branches.

The order of the branches are as follows:
* [dependencies](dependencies)
* [folder-structure](folder-structure)
* [driver-setup](driver-setup)
* [feature setup](feature-setup)

I hope this helps beginners to get a slight understanding on how to create a framework from scratch and some good 
practices to follow.
